# Using Q-Learning to tune control parameters(Status): I just started this... it's a work in progress. In short, let's try using Q-Learning to learn how to fly. Still lots of stuff left to do.In this project, we implement Q-Learning to tune gain parameters in Proportional-Derivative (PD) Control of a particle in free space.## Initial plots<p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/Q_learning_particle/blob/master/Figs/animation_05.gif" width="80%" /></p><p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/Q_learning_particle/blob/master/Figs/cost_05.png" width="80%" /></p><p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/Q_learning_particle/blob/master/Figs/rewards_05.png" width="80%" /></p>
