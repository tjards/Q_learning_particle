# Using Q-Learning to tune control parameters(Status): Still a work in progress.In this project, we implement Q-Learning to tune gain parameters in Proportional-Derivative (PD) Control of a particle in free space.## Initial plotsHere is an animation of the particle learning:<p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/Q_learning_particle/blob/master/Figs/animation_05.gif" width="80%" /></p>Note that the cost decreases with time:<p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/Q_learning_particle/blob/master/Figs/cost_05.png" width="80%" /></p>and, as we reduce the exploration rate, the rewards grow with time:<p float="center">  <img src="https://github.com/tjards/Q_learning_particle/blob/master/Figs/rewards_05.png" width="80%" /></p>
